"Why this blog?", you may ask.
Good question... the answer is simple.

I struggled to find an online resource in which I could comfortably reference any Design Patterns, with no headaches.
I then decided to seriously study these Patterns and break them down nicely, taking notes and put them here, for my own reference, because I also struggle to memorise information.

If I have this blog, I can always come back to it and reference my notes again and again, whenever I need to.

Please, contact me if you see anything wrong here, I will happily update this knowledge base for my own (and the community) benefit.

Thank-you and happy reading! ðŸ¤“
